;; Ownership Types Checker.
;;
;; Phases:
;; - Desugaring phase (ir>) :: Transforms the surface syntax into an
;;   Intermediate Representation.
;; - Meta phase (M>) :: Collects meta information for later use and
;;   checks no duplicate class/field/def names according to [FKF98]
;;   (see Bibliography).
;; - Simple type checking (?>) :: Type checks the program for simple
;;   types ("simple" as in simply typed λ calculus, i.e., no
;;   ownership). Based on [FKF98] (see Bibliography).
;; - Ownership type checking (Θ>) :: Type checks the program for
;;   ownership types. Based on [CPN98] (see Bibliography).
;;
;; Meta:
;; - meta:CS is the set of defined ownership scheme
;; - meta:FS is the map of fields with ownership type field as value
;; - meta:DS is the map of definitions with return ownership type as
;;   value
